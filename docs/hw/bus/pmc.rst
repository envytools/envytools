Introduction
============

PMC is the "master control" engine of the card. Its purpose is to provide
card identication, manage enable/disable bits of other engines, and handle
top-level interrupt routing.

.. _pmc-id:

Card identification
===================

The main register used to identify the card is the ID register. However,
the ID register has different formats depending on the GPU family:

.. reg:: 32 pmc-id-nv1 card identification

   - bits 0-3: minor revision.
   - bits 4-7: major revision.
     These two bitfields together are also visible as PCI revision. For
     NV3, revisions equal or higher than 0x20 mean NV3T.
   - bits 8-11: implementation - always 1 except on NV2
   - bits 12-15: always 0
   - bits 16-19: GPU - 1 is NV1, 2 is NV2, 3 is NV3 or NV3T
   - bits 20-27: always 0
   - bits 28-31: foundry - 0 is SGS, 1 is Helios, 2 is TMSC

.. reg:: 32 pmc-id-nv4 card identification

   - bits 0-3: ???
   - bits 4-11: always 0
   - bits 12-15: architecture - always 4
   - bits 16-19: minor revision
   - bits 20-23: major revision - 0 is NV4, 1 and 2 are NV5.
     These two bitfields together are also visible as PCI revision.
   - bits 24-27: always 0
   - bits 28-31: foundry - 0 is SGS, 1 is Helios, 2 is TMSC

.. reg:: 32 pmc-id-nv10 card identification

   - bits 0-7: stepping
   - bits 16-19: device id [NV10:G92]
   - bits 15-19: device id [G92:GF119]
   - bits 12-19: device id [GF119-]
     The value of this bitfield is equal to low 4, 5, or 6 bits of the PCI
     device id. The bitfield size and position changed between cards due to
     varying amount of changeable bits. See :ref:`pstraps` and
     :ref:`gpu` for more details.
   - bits 20-27: GPU id.
     This is THE GPU id that comes after "NV". See :ref:`gpu` for the
     list.
   - bits 28-31: ???

.. todo:: unk bitfields

G92[?] introduced another identification register in PMC, with unknown
purpose:

.. reg:: 32 pmc-boot-2 ???

   ???
 
.. todo:: what is this? when was it introduced? seen non-0 on at least G92

G94 introduced a new identification register with rearranged bitfields:

.. reg:: 32 pmc-new-id card identification

   - bits 0-7: device id
   - bits 8-11: same value as BOOT_2 register
   - bits 12-19: stepping
   - bits 20-27: GPU id

.. todo:: there are cards where the steppings don't match
   between registers - does this mean something or is it just
   a random screwup?


Endian switch
=============

PMC also contains the endian switch register. The endian switch can be set to
either little or big endian, and affects all accesses to BAR0 and, if present,
BAR2/BAR3 - see :ref:`bars` for more details. It is controlled by the ENDIAN
register:

.. reg:: 32 pmc-endian endian switch

   When read, returns 0x01000001 if in big-endian mode, 0 if in little-endian
   mode. When written, if bit 24 of the written value is 1, flips the endian
   switch to the opposite value, otherwise does nothing.

The register operates in such idiosyncratic way because it is itself affected
by the endian switch - thus the read value was chosen to be unaffected by
wrong endian setting, while write behavior was chosen so that writing "1" in
either endianness will switch the card to that endianness.

This register and the endian switch don't exist on pre-NV1A cards - they're
always little-endian.

Note that this switch is also used by G80+ PFIFO as its default endianness
- see :ref:`G80+ PFIFO<g80-pfifo>` for details.

The MMIO areas containing aliases of 8-bit VGA registers are unaffected by
this switch, despite being in BAR0.


.. _pmc-enable:

Engine enables
==============

PMC contains the main engine enable register, which is used to turn whole
engines on and off:

.. reg:: 32 pmc-enable engine master enable

   When given bit is set to 0, the corresponding engine is disabled, when set
   to 1, it is enabled. Most engines disappear from MMIO space and reset to
   default state when disabled.

- 0: :ref:`PAUDIO <nv1-paudio>`

Interrupts
==========

Another thing that PMC handles is the top-level interrupt routing. On cards
earlier than GT215, PMC gets interrupt lines from all interested engines on
the card, aggregates them together, adds in an option to trigger a "software"
interrupt manually, and routes them to the PCI INTA pin. There is an enable
register, but it only allows one to enable/disable all hardware or all
software interrupts.

GT215 introduced fine-grained interrupt masking, as well as an option to route
interrupts to PDAEMON. The HOST interrupts have a new redirection stage in
PDAEMON [see :ref:`pdaemon-iredir`] - while normally routed to the PCI interrupt line,
they may be switched over to PDAEMON delivery when it so decides. As a side
effect of that, powering off PDAEMON will disable host interrupt delivery.
A subset of interrupt types can also be routed to NRHOST destination, which
is identical to HOST, but doesn't go through the PDAEMON redirection circuitry.

.. todo:: change all this duplication to indexing

.. reg:: 32 pmc-intr-host interrupt status - host

   Interrupt status. Bits 0-30 are hardware interrupts, bit 31 is software
   interrupt. 1 if the relevant input interrupt line is active and, for GT215+
   GPUs, enabled in INTR_MASK_*. Bits 0-30 are read-only, bit 31 can be
   written to set/clear the software interrupt. Bit 31 can only be set to 1 if
   software interrupts are enabled in INTR_MASK_*, except for NRHOST on GF100+,
   where it works even if masked.

.. reg:: 32 pmc-intr-nrhost interrupt status - non-redirectable host

   Like :obj:`pmc-intr-host`, but for NRHOST.

.. reg:: 32 pmc-intr-daemon interrupt status - PDAEMON

   Like :obj:`pmc-intr-host`, but for DAEMON.

.. reg:: 32 pmc-intr-enable-host interrupt enable - host

  - bit 0: hardware interrupt enable - if 1, and any of bits 0-30 of INTR_* are
    active, the corresponding output interrupt line will be asserted.
  - bit 1: software interrupt enable - if 1, bit 31 of INTR_* is active, the
    corresponding output interrupt line will be asserted.

.. reg:: 32 pmc-intr-enable-nrhost interrupt enable - non-redirectable host

   Like :obj:`pmc-intr-enable-nrhost`, but for NRHOST.

.. reg:: 32 pmc-intr-enable-daemon interrupt enable - PDAEMON

   Like :obj:`pmc-intr-enable-host`, but for DAEMON.

.. reg:: 32 pmc-intr-line-host interrupt line status - host

   Provides a way to peek at the status of corresponding output interrupt line.
   On NV1:GF100, 0 if the output line is active, 1 if inactive. On GF100+, 1 if
   active, 0 if inactive.

.. reg:: 32 pmc-intr-line-nrhost interrupt line status - non-redirectable host

   Like :obj:`pmc-intr-line-host`, but for NRHOST.

.. reg:: 32 pmc-intr-line-daemon interrupt line status - PDAEMON

   Like :obj:`pmc-intr-line-host`, but for DAEMON.

.. reg:: 32 pmc-intr-mask-host interrupt mask - host

   Interrupt mask. If a bit is set to 0 here, it'll be masked off to always-0
   in the INTR_* register, otherwise it'll be connected to the corresponding
   input interrupt line. For HOST and DAEMON, all interrupts can be enabled.
   For NRHOST on pre-GF100 cards, only input line #8 [PFIFO] can be enabled, for
   NRHOST on GF100+ cards all interrupts but the software interrupt can be
   enabled - however in this case software interrupt works even without being
   enabled.

.. reg:: 32 pmc-intr-mask-nrhost interrupt mask - non-redirectable host

   Like :obj:`pmc-intr-mask-host`, but for NRHOST.

.. reg:: 32 pmc-intr-mask-daemon interrupt mask - PDAEMON

   Like :obj:`pmc-intr-mask-host`, but for DAEMON.

The HOST and NRHOST output interrupt lines are connected to the PCI INTA pin
on the card. HOST goes through PDAEMON's HOST interrupt redirection circuitry
[IREDIR], while NRHOST doesn't. DAEMON goes to PDAEMON's falcon interrupt line #10
[PMC_DAEMON].

On pre-GT215, each PMC interrupt input is a single 0/1 line. On GT215+, some
inputs have a single line for all three outputs, while some others have 2
lines: one for HOST and DAEMON outputs, and one for NRHOST outuput.

The input interrupts are, for NV1:

     area is always 4-byte aligned.
   - bit 31: hidden area enabled

.. reg:: 32 pmc-vram-hide-high VRAM hidden area high address

   - bits 0-28: address of end of the hidden area. bits 0-1 are ignored, the
     area is always 4-byte aligned.

The start and end addresses are both inclusive. All BAR1, BAR2/BAR3, PEEPHOLE
and PMEM/PRAMIN reads whose offsets fall into this window will be silently
mangled to read 0 instead. Writes are unaffected. Note that offset from start
of the BAR/PEEPHOLE/PRAMIN/PMEM is used for the comparison, not the actual
VRAM address - thus the selected window will cover a different thing in each
affected space.

The VRAM hidden area functionality got silently nuked on GF100+ GPUs. The
registers are still present, but they don't do anything.
