PSTRAPS: straps readout and override
====================================

.. contents::


Introduction
============

The nvidia GPU chips are used in multiple cards from multiple manufacturers.
Thus, the a single GPU can end up in many different configurations, with
varying memory amount, memory type, bus type, TV norm, crystal frequency, and
many other parameters. Since the GPU often needs to know what configuration
it is used in, a "straps" mechanism was invented to tell it this information.
On the first few cycles after reset, the memory bus pins are sampled. Since
nothing else is driving them at that point, their logic state is decided by
the pull-up or pull-down resistors placed by board manufacturer. The value
this read is used as the "straps" value and is used to configure many aspects
of GPU operation. Some of the straps are not used by the GPU itself, but are
intended for use by the BIOS or the driver.

NV01 has 5 straps bits, NV03 has 10 bits. NV04 bumped this count to 16 straps
bits, and allowed the driver to override the straps value at runtime. NV11
bumped the count to 22 bits, NV20 bumped it to 31 bits.

NV18 introduced a second set of 31 straps, and added another override
mechanism. Each straps set now consists of 2 31-bit values: primary and
secondary, and a 31-bit "select" mask that chooses which value is the source
of a given bit in the "effective" value used internally by the card. Both
primary and secondary value and select mask are set on reset from the BIOS
in ROM, but can be modified later. Straps 0 select, straps 0 secondary,
straps 1 select and straps 1 secondary are loaded from BIOS ROM offsets
0x58, 0x5c, 0x60, 0x64, respectively.

NVD9 introduced a third set.

When effective straps value changes for any reason, the changed value starts
being used by the card immediately.

The straps can be read or overriden by accessing the PSTRAPS area of MMIO,
which resides at addresses 0x608000-0x608fff [NV01] or 0x101000-0x101fff
[NV03+] in BAR0. It's also known as PEXTDEV by nvidia.

On NV03:NV17, PSTRAPS is enabled by PMC.ENABLE bit 20 [PFB], on later cards
and on NV01 it's unaffected by :ref:`PMC.ENABLE <pmc-enable>`.

On NV03:NV04 cards, the PSTRAPS area is also home to an unrelated register
controlling ROM timings.

NV01 straps
===========

On NV01, all straps bits are available in a single register:

MMIO 0x608000: STRAPS
  - bits 0-1: memory type
    - 0 - VRAM
    - 3 - DRAM
  - bits 2-3: board type
    - 0 - motherboard
    - 1 - adapter #1 [normal add-on cards use this value]
    - 2 - adapter #2
    - 3 - adapter #3
  - bit 4: bus type
    - 0 - PCI
    - 1 - VESA local bus

NV03+ straps readout/override registers
=======================================

MMIO 0x101000: STRAPS0_PRIMARY

MMIO 0x10100c: STRAPS1_PRIMARY [NV18:NV20 and NV25+ only]

MMIO 0x101034: STRAPS2_PRIMARY [NVD9+ only]
  - bits 0-30: straps primary value
  - bit 31: override enable [NV04+ only]

When writing, if bit 31 is 0, override is disabled, and the straps register
is restored to the original straps as read by the card on reset. If bit 31
is 1, override is enabled, and the straps value is set to the value written
by host.

MMIO 0x101004: STRAPS0_SELECT [NV18:NV20 and NV25+ only]

MMIO 0x101010: STRAPS1_SELECT [NV18:NV20 and NV25+ only]

MMIO 0x101038: STRAPS2_SELECT [NVD9+ only]
  - bits 0-30: strap source selection for strap bit X

When corresponding bit is set to 1, the card takes its value from the main
straps value, when corresponding bit is set to 0, the card takes its value from
the secondary value. This register is always writable and not affected by
override enable.

MMIO 0x101008: STRAPS0_SECONDARY [NV18:NV20 and NV25+ only]

MMIO 0x101014: STRAPS1_SECONDARY [NV18:NV20 and NV25+ only]

MMIO 0x10103c: STRAPS2_SECONDARY [NVD9+ only]
  - bits 0-30: straps secondary value

This register is always writable and not affected by override enable.
