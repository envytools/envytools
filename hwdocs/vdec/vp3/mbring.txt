The macroblock ring outputted from VLD is packet based, and aligned on
32-bit word size.

A packet has the header type in bits [24..31] and length in bits [0..23].
The data length is in words, and doesn't include the header itself.

For MPEG1/2 the following format is used:

type 00: Macro block header
The macro block header contains 4 data words:
 - Word 0:
   [0:15] Absolute address in macroblock units, 0 based
 - Word 1:
   [0:7] Y coord in macroblock units, 0 based
   [8:15] X coord in macroblock units, 0 based
 - Word 2:
   [0] not_coded[??]
   [1] skipped[??]
   [3] quant
   [4] motion_forward
   [5] motion_backward
   [6] coded_block_pattern
   [7] intra
   [26:26] dct_type
   [27:28] motion_type
     - 0: field motion
     - 1: frame-based motion
     - 2: 16x8 field
     - 3: dual prime motion
 - Word 3:
   [6:7] motion_vector_count
   [8:12] quantiser_scale_code

type 01: Motion vector
[XXX: Verify whether X or Y is in the lowest 16 bits. I assume X]
The motion vector has a length of 4 data words, and contains a total of
8 PMVs with a size of 16 bits each. The motion vectors are likely
encoded in order of the spec with PMV[r][s][t].

The layout of each 16 bit PMV:
  [0:5] motion code
  [6:13] residual
  [14] motion_vertical_field_select
  [14:15] dmvector (0, 1, or 3)
motion_vertical_field_select and dmvector occupy same bits, but the mpeg
spec makes them mutually exclusive, so they don't conflict.

type 02: DCT coordinates
A packet of this type is created for each pattern enabled in
coded_block_pattern. This packet type is byte oriented, rather than word
oriented. It splits the coordinates up in chunks of 4 coordinates each,
so 0..3 becomes 0, 4..7 becomes 1, 60..63 becomes chunk 15. The first 2
bytes contain a 16-bit bitmask indicating the presence of each chunk. If
a chunks bit is set it will be encoded further.
For each present chunk a 8-bit bitmask will be created, which contains the
size of each coordinate in that chunk. 2 bits are used for each coordinate,
indicating the size (0 = not present, 1 = 1 byte, 2 = 2 bytes).
This is followed by all coordinates present in this chunk, the last chunk
is padded with 0s to align to word size.

For example: 0x10 0x00 0x40 0xff
Chunk 4 (0x0010>>4)&1 has pos 3 (0x40 >> (2*3))&3 set to -1

type 04: Coded block pattern
This packet puts coded_block_pattern in 1 data word.

type 06: End of stream
This header has no length, and signals the parser it's done.

A macroblock is created in this order:
 - motion vector (optional)
 - macro block header
 - DCT coordinates (optional, and repeated as many times as needed)
 - coded_block_pattern (optional)
'optional' is relative to the MPEG spec. For example intra frames always
require a coded_block_pattern.
