= Introduction =

Data segment of the fuc is inside the microcontroller itself. Its size can
be determined by looking at UC_CAPS register, bits 9-16 shifted left by 8
[see fuc-ctrl.txt].

The segment has byte-oriented addressing and can be accessed in units of 8,
16, or 32 bits. Unaligned accesses are not supported and cause botched reads
or writes.

The stack is also stored in data segment. Stack pointer is stored in $sp
special register and is always aligned to 4 bytes. Stack grows downwards,
with $sp pointing at the last pushed value. The low 2 bits of $sp and bits
higher than what's needed to span the data space are forced to 0.

Multi-byte quantities are stored as little-endian.


= Pseudocode conventions =

sz, for sized instructions, is the selected size of operation: 8, 16, or 32.

LD(size, address) returns the contents of size-bit quantity in data segment
at specified address:

int LD(size, addr) {
	if (size == 32) {
		addr &= ~3;
		return D[addr] | D[addr + 1] << 8 | D[addr + 2] << 16 | D[addr + 3] << 24;
	} else if (size == 16) {
		addr &= ~1;
		return D[addr] | D[addr + 1] << 8;
	} else { // size == 8
		return D[addr];
	}
}

ST(size, address, value) stores the given size-bit value to data segment.

void ST(size, addr, val) {
	if (size == 32) {
		if (addr & 1) { // fuck up the written datum as penalty for unaligned access.
			val = (val & 0xff) << (addr & 3) * 8;
		} else if (addr & 2) {
			val = (val & 0xffff) << (addr & 3) * 8;
		}
		addr &= ~3;
		D[addr] = val;
		D[addr + 1] = val >> 8;
		D[addr + 2] = val >> 16;
		D[addr + 3] = val >> 24;
	} else if (size == 16) {
		if (addr & 1) {
			val = (val & 0xff) << (addr & 1) * 8;
		}
		addr &= ~1;
		D[addr] = val;
		D[addr + 1] = val >> 8;
	} else { // size == 8
		D[addr] = val;
	}
}


= Load: ld =

Loads 8-bit, 16-bit or 32-bit quantity from data segment to register.

Instructions:
	ld - Load a value from data segment.
Instruction class: sized
Operands: DST, BASE, IDX
Forms:
	R1, R2, I8				opcode = 10, subopcode = 8
	R2, $sp, I8				opcode = 34, subopcode = 0
	R2, $sp, R1				opcode = 3a, subopcode = 0
	R3, R2, R1				opcode = 3c, subopcode = 8
Immediates: zero-extended
Operation:
	DST = LD(sz, BASE + IDX * (sz/8));


= Store: st =

Stores 8-bit, 16-bit or 32-bit quantity from register to data segment.

Instructions:
	st - Store a value to data segment.
Instruction class: sized
Operands: BASE, IDX, SRC
Forms:
	R2, I8, R1				opcode = 00, subopcode = 0
	$sp, I8, R2				opcode = 30, subopcode = 1
	R2, 0, R1				opcode = 38, subopcode = 1
	$sp, R1, R2				opcode = 38, subopcode = 1
Immediates: zero-extended
Operation:
	ST(sz, BASE + IDX * (sz/8), SRC);


= Push onto stack: push =

Decrements $sp by 4, then stores a 32-bit value at top of the stack.

Instructions:
	push - Push a value onto stack		subopcode = 0
Instruction class: unsized
Operands: SRC
Forms:
	R2					opcode = f9
Operation:
	$sp -= 4;
	ST(32, $sp, SRC);


= Pop from stack: pop =

Loads 32-bit value from top of the stack, then incrments $sp by 4.

Instructions:
	pop - Pops a value from the stack	subopcode = 0
Instruction class: unsized
Operands: DST
Forms:
	R2					opcode = f2
Operation:
	DST = LD(32, $sp);
	$sp += 4;


= Adjust stack pointer: add =

Adds a value to the stack pointer

Instructions:
	add - Add a value to the stack pointer.
Instruction class: unsized
Operands: DST, SRC
Forms:
	$sp, I8				opcode = f4, subopcode = 30
	$sp, I16			opcode = f5, subopcode = 30
	$sp, R2				opcode = f9, subopcode = 1

Operation:
	$sp += SRC;


= Accessing data segment through IO =

On v3+, the data segment is accessible through normal IO space through
index/data reg pairs. The number of available index/data pairs is accessible
by UC_CAPS2 register [see fuc-ctrl.txt]. This number is equal to 4 on PDAEMON,
1 on other engines:

MMIO 0x1c0 + i * 8 / I[0x07000 + i * 0x200]: DATA_INDEX
  Selects the place in D[] accessed by DATA reg.
  bits 2-15: bits 2-15 of the data address to poke
  bit 24: write autoincrement flag: if set, every write to corresponding DATA
          register increments the address by 4
  bit 25: read autoincrement flag: like 24, but for reads

MMIO 0x1c4 + i * 8 / I[0x07100 + i * 0x200]: DATA
  Writes execute ST(32, DATA_INDEX & 0xfffc, value); and increment the address
  if write autoincrement is enabled. Reads return the result of LD(32,
  DATA_INDEX & 0xfffc); and increment if read autoincrement is enabled.

i should be less than DATA_PORTS value from UC_CAPS2 register.

On v0, the data segment is instead accessible through the high fuc MMIO range,
see fuc-io.txt for details.
