= Introduction =

The arithmetic/logical instructions do operations on $r0-$r15 GPRs, sometimes
setting bits in $flags register according to the result. The instructions
can be "sized" or "unsized". Sized instructions have 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit
variants. Unsized instructions don't have variants, and always operate on
full 32-bit registers. For 8-bit and 16-bit sized instructions, high 24 or 16
bits of destination registers are unmodified.

The flags potentially affected by ALU instructions are:

 - bit 8: c, carry flag
 - bit 9: o, signed overflow flag
 - bit a: s, sign flag
 - bit b: z, zero flag

Also, a few ALU instructions operate on $flags register as a whole.


= Pseudocode conventions =

All operations are done in infinite-precision arithmetic, all temporaries
are infinite-precision too.

sz, for sized instructions, is the selected size of operation: 8, 16, or 32.

S(x) evaluates to (x >> (sz - 1) & 1), ie. the sign bit of x. If insn
is unsized, assume sz = 32.


= Comparison: cmpu, cmps, cmp =

Compare two values, setting flags according to results of comparison. cmp
sets the usual set of 4 flags. cmpu sets only c and z. cmps sets z normally,
and sets c if SRC1 is less then SRC2 when treated as signed number.

cmpu/cmps are the only comparison instructions available on fµc v0. Both of
them set only the c and z flags, with cmps setting c flag in an unusual way
to enable signed comparisons while using unsigned flags and condition codes.
To do an unsigned comparison, use cmpu and the unsigned branch conditions
[b/a/e]. To do a signed comparison, use cmps, also with unsigned branch
conditions.

The fµc v3+ new cmp instruction sets the full set of flags. To do an unsigned
comparison on v3+, use cmp and the unsigned branch conditions. To do a signed
comparison, use cmp and the signed branch conditions [l/g/e].
