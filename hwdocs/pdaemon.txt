= Introduction =

PDAEMON is a fµc-based engine introduced on NVA3. Its main purpose is
autonomous power and thermal management, but it can be used to oversee any part
of GPU operation. The PDAEMON has many dedicated connections to various parts
of the GPU.

The PDAEMON is made of:

 - a fµc microprocessor core
 - standard fµc memory interface unit
 - a simple channel load interface, replacing the usual PFIFO interface
 - various means of communication betwen fµc and host
 - engine power gating controllers for the PFIFO-connected engines
 - "idle" signals from various engines and associated idle counters
 - misc simple input/output signals to various engines, with interrupt
   capability
 - a oneshot/periodic timer, using daemon clock or PTIMER as clock source
 - PMC interrupt redirection circuitry
 - indirect MMIO access circuitry
 - direct interface to all PTHERM registers
 - CRC computation hardware

 - NVAF:NVC0 - added a third instance of power gating controller for PUNK1C1
   engine
 - NVC0:NVD9 - removed PUNK1C1 support, added second set of input/output
   signals and [XXX: some unknown bits]
 - NVD9:NVE4 - changed I[] space layout, added [XXX: what?]
 - NVE4- - a new version of engine power gating controller and [XXX: what?]

= IO register space =

On NVA3:NVD9, PDAEMON uses the "classic" fµc addressing scheme: I[] space
addresses are shifted left by 6 wrt the offsets in MMIO window - ie. I[0x12300]
can be accessed through MMIO address 0x10a48c, and registers are usually 0x100
bytes apart in the I[] space and aliased over that 0x100-byte range to be
easily accessible by MMIO. On NVD9+, however, I[] addresses correspond directly
to offsets in MMIO window - I[0x48c] can be accessed through MMIO 0x10a48c.

The following registers/register ranges exist on PDAEMON [first number is MMIO
offset and I[] address on NVD9+, second is I[] address on NVA3:NVD9]:

Notes:
 - the last 0x20 bytes of THERM range on NVA3:NVD9 aren't accessible by the
   host, since they're hidden by the overlapping fµc host-only control
   registers
 - the THERM range on NVD9+ is not accessible at all by the host, since its
   base address is above the end of the MMIO window to fµc's I[] space

Neither is a problem in practice, since the host can just access the same
registers via the PTHERM range.

= Second-level interrupts =

Because fµc has space for only 8 engine interrupts and PDAEMON needs many
more, a second-level interrupt register was introduced:

MMIO 0x688 / I[0x1a200]: SUBINTR
  bit 0: H2D - host to PDAEMON scratch register written [see H2D_INTR]
  bit 1: FIFO - host to PDAEMON fifo pointer updated [see FIFO_INTR]
  bit 2: EPWR_GRAPH - PGRAPH engine power control [XXX]
  bit 3: EPWR_VDEC - video decoding engine power control [XXX]
  bit 4: MMIO - indirect MMIO access error [see MMIO_INTR]
  bit 5: IREDIR_ERR - interrupt redirection error [see IREDIR_ERR_INTR]
  bit 6: IREDIR_HOST_REQ - interrupt redirection request [see IREDIR_TRIGGER]
  bit 7: ??? [XXX]
  bit 8: ??? - goes to 0x670 [XXX]
  bit 9: EPWR_PUNK1C1 [NVAF] - PUNK1C1 engine power control [XXX]
  [XXX: more bits here?]
  bit 13: ??? [NVD9-] - goes to 0x888 [XXX]

The second-level interrupts are merged into a single level-triggered interrupt
and delivered to fµc interrupt line 11. This line is asserted whenever any bit
of SUBINTR register is non-0. A given SUBINTR bit is set to 1 whenever the
input second-level interrupt line is 1, but will not auto-clear when the input
line goes back to 0 - only writing 1 to that bit in SUBINTR will clear it.
This effectively means that SUBINTR bits have to be cleared after the
downstream interrupt. Note that SUBINTR has no corresponding enable bit - if
an interrupt needs to be disabled, software should use the enable registers
corresponding to individual second-level interrupts instead.

Note that IREDIR_HOST_REQ interrupt has special semantics when cleared - see
IREDIR_TRIGGER documentation.


= User busy indication =

To enable the microcode to set the "PDAEMON is busy" flag without actually
making any PDAEMON subunit perform computation, bit 4 of the fµc status
register is connected to a dummy unit whose busy status is controlled directly
by the user:

MMIO 0x420 / I[0x10800]: USER_BUSY
  Read/write, only bit 0 is valid. If set, fµc status line 4 [USER] is set to 1
  [busy], otherwise it's set to 0 [idle].

[XXX: what could possibly use PDAEMON's busy status?]


= Host <-> PDAEMON communication =

There are 4 PDAEMON-specific channels that can be used for communication
between the host and PDAEMON:

 - FIFO: data submission from host to PDAEMON on 4 independent FIFOs in data
   segment, with interrupts generated whenever the PUT register is written
 - RFIFO: data submission from PDAEMON to host on through a FIFO in data
   segment
 - H2D: a single scratch register for host -> PDAEMON communication, with
   interrupts generated whenever it's written
 - D2H: a single scratch register for PDAEMON -> host communication
 - DSCRATCH: 4 scratch registers


== Submitting data to PDAEMON: FIFO ==

These registers are meant to be used for submitting data from host to PDAEMON.
The PUT register is FIFO head, written by host, and GET register is FIFO tail,
written by PDAEMON. Interrupts can be generated whenever the PUT register is
written. How exactly the data buffer works is software's business. Note that
due to very limitted special semantics for FIFO uage, these registers may as
well be used as [possibly interruptful] scratch registers.

MMIO 0x4a0+i*4 / I[0x12800+i*0x100], i<4: FIFO_PUT[i]
  The FIFO head pointer, effectively a 32-bit scratch register. Writing it
  causes bit i of FIFO_INTR to be set.

MMIO 0x4b0+i*4 / I[0x12c00+i*0x100], i<4: FIFO_GET[i]
  The FIFO tail pointer, effectively a 32-bit scratch register.

MMIO 0x4c0 / I[0x13000]: FIFO_INTR
  The status register for FIFO_PUT write interrupts. Write a bit with 1 to
  clear it. Whenever a bit is set both in FIFO_INTR and FIFO_INTR_EN, the FIFO
  [#1] second-level interrupt line to SUBINTR is asserted. Bit i corresponds to
  FIFO #i, and only bits 0-3 are valid.

MMIO 0x4c4 / I[0x13100]: FIFO_INTR_EN
  The enable register for FIFO_PUT write interrupts. Read/write, only 4 low
  bits are valid. Bit assignment is the same as in FIFO_INTR.

In addition, the FIFO circuitry exports four signals to PCOUNTER:
 - FIFO_PUT_0_WRITE: pulses for one cycle whenever FIFO_PUT[0] is written
 - FIFO_PUT_1_WRITE: pulses for one cycle whenever FIFO_PUT[1] is written
 - FIFO_PUT_2_WRITE: pulses for one cycle whenever FIFO_PUT[2] is written
 - FIFO_PUT_3_WRITE: pulses for one cycle whenever FIFO_PUT[3] is written


== Submitting data to host: RFIFO ==

The RFIFO is like one of the 4 FIFOs, except it's supposed to go from PDAEMON
to the host and doesn't have the interupt generation powers.

MMIO 0x4c8 / I[0x13200]: RFIFO_PUT
MMIO 0x4cc / I[0x13300]: RFIFO_GET
  The RFIFO head and tail pointers. Both are effectively 32-bit scratch
  registers.


== Host to PDAEMON scratch register: H2D ==

H2D is a scratch register supposed to be written by the host and read by
PDAEMON. It generates an interrupt when written.

MMIO 0x4d0 / I[0x13400]: H2D
  A 32-bit scratch register. Sets H2D_INTR when written.

MMIO 0x4d4 / I[0x13500]: H2D_INTR
  The status register for H2D write interrupt. Only bit 0 is valid. Set when
  H2D register is written, cleared when 1 is written to bit 0. When this and
  H2D_INTR_EN are both set, the H2D [#0] second-level interrupt line to
  SUBINTR is asserted.

MMIO 0x4d8 / I[0x13600]: H2D_INTR_EN
  The enable register for H2D write interrupt. Only bit 0 is valid.


== PDAEMON to host scratch register: D2H ==

D2H is just a scratch register supposed to be written by PDAEMON and read by
the host. It has no interrupt genration powers.

MMIO 0x4dc / I[0x13700]: D2H
  A 32-bit scratch register.


== Scratch registers: DSCRATCH ==

DSCRATCH[] are just 4 32-bit scratch registers usable for PDAEMON<->HOST
communication or any other purposes.

MMIO 0x5d0+i*4 / I[0x17400+i*0x100], i<4: DSCRATCH[i]
  A 32-bit scratch register.


= Hardware mutexes =

The PDAEMON has hardware support for 16 busy-waiting mutexes accessed by up to
254 clients simultanously. The clients may be anything able to read and write
the PDAEMON registers - code running on host, on PDAEMON, or on any other fµc
engine with MMIO access powers.

The clients are identified by tokens. Tokens are 8-bit numbers in 0x01-0xfe
range. Tokens may be assigned to clients statically by software, or dynamically
by hardware. Only tokens 0x08-0xfe will be dynamically allocated by hardware
- software may use statically assigned tokens 0x01-0x07 even if dynamic tokens
are in use at the same time. The registers used for dynamic token allocation
are:

MMIO 0x488 / I[0x12200]: TOKEN_ALLOC
  Read-only, each to this register allocates a free token and gives it as the
  read result. If there are no free tokens, 0xff is returned.

MMIO 0x48c / I[0x12300]: TOKEN_FREE
  A write to this register will free a token, ie. return it back to the pool
  used by TOKEN_ALLOC. Only low 8 bits of the written value are used.
  Attempting to free a token outside of the dynamic allocation range
  [0x08-0xff] or a token already in the free queue will have no effect.
  Reading this register will show the last written value, invalid or not.

The free tokens are stored in a FIFO - the freed tokens will be used by
TOKEN_ALLOC in the order of freeing. After reset, the free token FIFO will
contain tokens 0x08-0xfe in ascending order.

The actual mutex locking and unlocking is done by the MUTEX_TOKEN registers:

MMIO 0x580+i*4 / I[0x16000+i*0x100], i<16: MUTEX_TOKEN[i]
  The 16 mutices. A value of 0 means unlocked, any other value means locked
  by the client holding the corresponding token. Only low 8 bits of the written
  value are used. A write of 0 will unlock the mutex and will always succeed.
  A write of 0x01-0xfe will succeed only if the mutex is currently unlocked.
  A write of 0xff is invalid and will always fail. A failed write has no
  effect.

The token allocation circuitry additionally exports four signals to PCOUNTER:

 - TOKEN_ALL_USED: 1 iff all tokens are currently allocated [ie. a read from
   TOKEN_ALLOC would return 0xff]
 - TOKEN_NONE_USED: 1 iff no tokens are currently allocated [ie. tokens
   0x08-0xfe are all in free tokens queue]
 - TOKEN_FREE: pulses for 1 cycle whenever TOKEN_FREE is written, even if with
   invalid value
 - TOKEN_ALLOC: pulses for 1 cycle whenever TOKEN_ALLOC is read, even if
   allocation fails


= CRC computation =

The PDAEMON has a very simple CRC accelerator. Specifically, it can perform
the CRC accumulation operation on 32-bit chunks using the standard CRC-32
polynomial of 0xedb88320. The current CRC residual is stored in the CRC_STATE
register:

MMIO 0x494 / I[0x12500]: CRC_STATE
  The current CRC residual. Read/write.

And the data to add to the CRC is written to the CRC_DATA register:

MMIO 0x490 / I[0x12400]: CRC_DATA
  When written, appends the 32-bit LE value to the running CRC residual in
  CRC_STATE. When read, returns the last value written. Write operation:
	CRC_STATE ^= value;
	for (i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
		if (CRC_STATE & 1) {
			CRC_STATE >>= 1;
			CRC_STATE ^= 0xedb88320;
		} else {
			CRC_STATE >>= 1;
		}
	}

To compute a CRC:
1. Write the initial CRC residue to CRC_STATE
2. Write all data to CRC_DATA, in 32-bit chunks
3. Read CRC_STATE, xor its value with the final constant, use that as the CRC.

If the data block to CRC has size that is not a multiple of 32 bits, the extra
bits at the end [or the beginning] have to be handled manually.


= The timer =

Aside from the usual fµc timers [see fuc-timer.txt], PDAEMON has its own
timer. The timer can be configured as either one-shot or periodic, can run
on either daemon clock or PTIMER clock divided by 64, and generates
interrupts. The following registers deal with the timer:

MMIO 0x4e0 / I[0x13800]: TIMER_START
  The 32-bit count the timer starts counting down from. Read/write. For
  periodic mode, the period will be equal to TIMER_START+1 source cycles.

MMIO 0x4e4 / I[0x13900]: TIMER_TIME
  The current value of the timer, read only. If TIMER_CONTROL.RUNNING is set,
  this will decrease by 1 on every rising edge of the source clock. If such
  rising edge causes this register to become 0, the TIMER_INTR bit 8 [TIMER]
  is set. The behavior of rising edge when this register is already 0 depends
  on the timer mode: in ONESHOT mode, nothing will happen. In PERIODIC mode,
  the timer will be reset to the value from TIMER_START. Note that interrupts
  won't be generated if the timer becomes 0 when copying the value from
  TIMER_START, whether caused by starting the timer or beginning a new PERIODIC
  period. This means that using PERIODIC mode with TIMER_START of 0 will never
  generate any interrupts.

MMIO 0x4e8 / I[0x13a00]: TIMER_CTRL
  bit 0: RUNNING - when 0, the timer is stopped, when 1, the timer is runinng.
    Setting this bit to 1 when it was previously 0 will also copy the
    TIMER_START value to TIMER_TIME.
  bit 4: SOURCE - selects the source clock
    0: DCLK - daemon clock, effectively timer decrements by 1 on every daemon
       cycle
    1: PTIMER_B5 - PTIMER time bit 5 [ie. bit 10 of TIME_LOW]. Since timer
       decrements by 1 on every rising edge of the clock, this effectively
       decrements the counter on every 64th PTIMER clock.
  bit 8: MODE - selects the timer mode
    0: ONESHOT - timer will halt after reaching 0
    1: PERIODIC - timer will restart from TIMER_START after reaching 0

MMIO 0x680 / I[0x1a000]: TIMER_INTR
  bit 8: TIMER - set whenever TIMER_TIME becomes 0 except by a copy from
    TIMER_START, write 1 to this bit to clear it. When this and bit 8
    of TIMER_INTR_EN are set at the same time, fµc interrupt line #14 [TIMER]
    is asserted.

MMIO 0x684 / I[0x1a100]: TIMER_INTR_EN
  bit 8: TIMER - when set, timer interupt delivery to fµc interrupt line 14 is
  enabled.

[XXX: write me]


= PMC interrupt redirection =

One of PDAEMON powers is redirecting the PMC INTR_HOST interrupt to itself.
The redirection hw may be in one of two states:
 - HOST: PMC INTR_HOST output connected to PCI interrupt line [ORed with PMC
   INTR_NRHOST output], PDAEMON fµc interrupt #15 disconnected and forced to 0
 - DAEMON: PMC INTR_HOST output connected to PDAEMON fµc interrupt #15
   [IREDIR_PMC], PCI interrupt line connected to INTR_NRHOST output only

In addition, there's a capability enabling host to send "please turn redirect
status back to HOST" interrupt with a timeout mechanism that will execute
the request in hardware if the PDAEMON fails to respond to the interrupt in
a given time.

Note that, as a side effect of having this circuitry, PMC INTR_HOST line will
be delivered nowhere [fµc interrupt line #15 will be 0, PCI interrupt line
will be connected to INTR_NRHOST only] whenever the IREDIR circuitry is in
reset state, due to either whole PDAEMON reset through PMC.ENABLE /
PDAEMON_ENABLE or DAEMON circuitry reset via SUBENGINE_RESET with DAEMON
set in the reset mask.

The redirection state may be read at:

MMIO 0x690 / I[0x1a400]: IREDIR_STATUS
  Read-only. Reads as 0 if redirect hw is in HOST state, 1 if it's in DAEMON
  state.

The redirection state may be controlled by:

MMIO 0x68c / I[0x1a300]: IREDIR_TRIGGER
  This register is write-only.
  bit 0: HOST_REQ - when written as 1, sends the "request redirect state change
    to HOST" interrupt, setting SUBINTR bit #6 [IREDIR_HOST_REQ] to 1 and
    starting the timeout, if enabled. When written as 1 while redirect hw is
    already in HOST state, will just cause HOST_REQ_REDUNDANT error instead.
  bit 4: DAEMON - when written as 1, sets the redirect hw state to DAEMON.
    If it was set to DAEMON already, causes DAEMON_REDUNDANT error.
  bit 12: HOST - when written as 1, sets the redirect hw state to HOST. If it
    was set to HOST already, causes HOST_REDUNDANT error. Does *not* clear
    IREDIR_HOST_REQ interrupt bit.
  Writing a value with multiple bits set is not a good idea - one of them will
  cause an error.

The IREDIR_HOST_REQ interrupt state should be cleared by writing 1 to the
corresponding SUBINTR bit. Once this is done, the timeout counting stops,
and redirect hw goes to HOST state if it wasn't already.

The IREDIR_HOST_REQ timeout is controlled by the following registers:

MMIO 0x694 / I[0x1a500]: IREDIR_TIMEOUT
  The timeout duration in daemon cycles. Read/write, 32-bit.

MMIO 0x6a4 / I[0x1a900]: IREDIR_TIMEOUT_ENABLE
  The timeout enable. Only bit 0 is valid. When set to 0, timeout mechanism
  is disabled, when set to 1, it's active. Read/write.

When timeout mechanism is enabled and IREDIR_HOST_REQ interupt is triggered,
a hidden counter starts counting down. If IREDIR_TIMEOUT cycles go by without
the interrupt being acked, the redirect hw goes to HOST state, the interrupt
is cleared, and HOST_REQ_TIMEOUT error is triggered.

The redirect hw errors will trigger the IREDIR_ERR interrupt, which is
connected to SUBINTR bit #5. The registers involved are:

MMIO 0x698 / I[0x1a600]: IREDIR_ERR_DETAIL
  Read-only, shows detailed error status. All bits are auto-cleared when
  IREDIR_ERR_INTR is cleared
  bit 0: HOST_REQ_TIMEOUT - set when the IREDIR_HOST_REQ interrupt times out
  bit 4: HOST_REQ_REDUNDANT - set when HOST_REQ is poked in IREDIR_TRIGGER
    while the hw is already in HOST state
  bit 12: DAEMON_REDUNDANT - set when HOST is poked in IREDIR_TRIGGER while the
    hw is already in DAEMON state
  bit 12: HOST_REDUNDANT - set when HOST is poked in IREDIR_TRIGGER while the
    hw is already in HOST state

MMIO 0x69c / I[0x1a700]: IREDIR_ERR_INTR
  The status register for IREDIR_ERR interrupt. Only bit 0 is valid. Set when
  any of the 4 errors happens, cleared [along with all IREDIR_ERR_DETAIL bits]
  when 1 is written to bit 0. When this and IREDIR_ERR_INTR_EN are both set,
  the IREDIR_ERR [#5] second-level interrupt line to SUBINTR is asserted.

MMIO 0x6a0 / I[0x1a800]: IREDIR_ERR_INTR_EN
  The enable register for IREDIR_ERR interrupt. Only bit 0 is valid.

The interrupt redirection circuitry also exports the following signals to
PCOUNTER:

 - IREDIR_STATUS: current redirect hw status, like the IREDIR_STATUS reg.
 - IREDIR_HOST_REQ: 1 if the IREDIR_HOST_REQ [SUBINTR #6] interrupt is pending
 - IREDIR_TRIGGER_DAEMON: pulses for 1 cycle whenever INTR_TRIGGER.DAEMON is
   written as 1, whether it results in an error or not
 - IREDIR_TRIGGER_HOST: pulses for 1 cycle whenever INTR_TRIGGER.HOST is
   written as 1, whether it results in an error or not
 - IREDIR_PMC: 1 if the PMC INTR_HOST line is active and directed to DAEMON
   [ie. mirrors fµc interrupt #15 input]
 - IREDIR_INTR: 1 if any IREDIR interrupt is active - IREDIR_HOST_REQ,
   IREDIR_ERR, or IREDIR_PMC. IREDIR_ERR does not count if IREDIR_ERR_INTR_EN
   is not set.


= PTHERM access =

PDAEMON can access all PTHERM registers directly, without having to go through
the generic MMIO access functionality. The THERM range in the PDAEMON register
space is mapped straight to PTHERM MMIO register range.

On NVA3:NVD9, PTHERM registers are mapped into the I[] space at addresses
0x20000:0x40000, with addresses being shifted left by 6 bits wrt their address
in PTHERM - PTHERM register 0x20000+x would be visible at I[0x20000 + x * 0x40]
by fµc, or at 0x10a800+x in MMIO [assuming it wouldn't fall into the reserved
0x10afe0:0x10b000 range]. On NVD9+, the PTHERM registers are instead mapped
into the I[] space at addresses 0x1000:0x1800, without shifting - PTHERM reg
0x20000+x is visible at I[0x1000+x]. On NVD9+, the alias area is not visible
via MMIO [just access PTHERM registers directly instead].

Reads to the PTHERM-mapped area will always perform 32-bit reads to the
corresponding PTHERM regs. Writes, however, have their byte enable mask
controlled via a PDAEMON register, enabling writes with sizes other than
32-bit:

MMIO 0x5f4 / I[0x17d00]: THERM_BYTE_MASK
  Read/write, only low 4 bits are valid, initialised to 0xf on reset. Selects
  the byte mask to use when writing the THERM range. Bit i corresponds to
  bits i*8..i*8+7 of the written 32-bit value.

The PTHERM access circuitry also exports a signal to PCOUNTER:

 - THERM_ACCESS_BUSY: 1 while a THERM range read/write is in progress - will
   light up for a dozen or so cycles per access, depending on relative clock
   speeds.

In addition to direct register access to PTHERM, PDAEMON also has direct access
to PTHERM interrupts - fµc interrupt #12 [THERM] comes from PTHERM interrupt
aggregator. PTHERM subinterrupts can be individually assigned for PMC or
PDAEMON delivery - see ptherm.txt for more information.

XXX: TODO


= Accessing the whole MMIO range =

PDAEMON can access the whole MMIO range through the IO space.

To read from a MMIO address, poke the address into MMIO_ADDR then trigger a read
by poking 0x100f1 to MMIO_CTRL. Wait for MMIO_CTRL's bits 12-14 to be cleared
then read the value from MMIO_VALUE.

To write to a MMIO address, poke the address into MMIO_ADDR, poke the value
to be written into MMIO_VALUE then trigger a write by poking 0x100f2 to
MMIO_CTRL. Wait for MMIO_CTRL's bits 12-14 to be cleared if you want to
make sure the write has been completed.

Accessing an unexisting address will set MMIO_CTRL's bit 13 after MMIO_TIMEOUT
cycles have passed.

NVD9 introduced the possibility to choose from which access point should
the MMIO request be sent. ROOT can access everything, IBUS accesses everything
minus PMC, PBUS, PFIFO, PPCI and a few other top-level MMIO range.
On nvd9+, accessing an un-existing address with the ROOT access point can lead
to a hard-lock.
XXX: What's the point of this feature?

It is possible to get an interrupt when an error occurs by poking 1 to
MMIO_INTR_EN. The interrupt will be fired on line 11. The error is described
in MMIO_ERR.

MMIO 0x7a0 / I[0x1e800]: MMIO_ADDR
  Specifies the MMIO address that will be written to/read from by MMIO_CTRL.

  On nva3-d9, this register only contains the address to be accessed.

  On nvd9, this register became a bitfield:
  bits 0-25: ADDR
  bit 27: ACCESS_POINT
    0: ROOT
    1: IBUS

MMIO 0x7a4 / I[0x1e900]: MMIO_VALUE
  The value that will be written to / is read from MMIO_ADDR when an operation
  is triggered by MMIO_CTRL.

MMIO 0x7a8 / I[0x1e900]: MMIO_TIMEOUT
  Specifies the timeout for MMIO access.
  XXX: Clock source? PDAEMON's core clock, PTIMER's, Host's?

MMIO 0x7ac / I[0x1eb00]: MMIO_CTRL
  Process the MMIO request with given params (MMIO_ADDR, MMIO_VALUE).
  bits 0-1: request
    0: XXX
    1: read
    2: write
    3: XXX
  bits 4-7: BYTE_MASK
  bit 12: BUSY [RO]
  bit 13: TIMEOUT [RO]
  bit 14: FAULT [RO]
  bit 16: TRIGGER

MMIO 0x7b0 / I[0x1ec00] : MMIO_ERR
  Specifies the MMIO error status:
    - TIMEOUT: ROOT/IBUS has not answered PDAEMON's request
    - CMD_WHILE_BUSY: a request has been fired while being busy
    - WRITE: set if the request was a write, cleared if it was a read
    - FAULT: No engine answered ROOT/IBUS's request
  On nva3-d9, clearing MMIO_INTR's bit 0 will also clear MMIO_ERR.
  On nvd9+, clearing MMIO_ERR is done by poking 0xffffffff.

  Nva3-c0:
  bit 0: TIMEOUT
  bit 1: CMD_WHILE_BUSY
  bit 2: WRITE
  bits 3-31: ADDR

  Nvc0-d9:
  bit 0: TIMEOUT
  bit 1: CMD_WHILE_BUSY
  bit 2: WRITE
  bits 3-30: ADDR
  bit 31: FAULT

  Nvd9+:
  bit 0: TIMEOUT_ROOT
  bit 1: TIMEOUT_IBUS
  bit 2: CMD_WHILE_BUSY
  bit 3: WRITE
  bits 4-29: ADDR
  bit 30: FAULT_ROOT
  bit 31: FAULT_IBUS

MMIO 0x7b4 / I[0x1ed00] : MMIO_INTR
  Specifies which MMIO interrupts are active. Clear the associated bit to ACK.
  bit 0: ERR
    Clearing this bit will also clear MMIO_ERR on nva3-d9.

MMIO 0x7b8 / I[0x1ee00] : MMIO_INTR_EN
  Specifies which MMIO interrupts are enabled. Interrupts will be fired on
  line 11 [fuc-intr.txt].
  bit 0: ERR
