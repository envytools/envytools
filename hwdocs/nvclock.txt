The nvidia GPUs, like most electronic devices, use clock signals to control
their operation. Since they're complicated devices made of many subunits with
different performance needs, there are multiple clock signals for various
parts of the GPU.

The set of available clocks and the method of setting them varies a lot with
the card type.

NV01:NV40 chipsets have the following clocks:

 - core clock [NVPLL]: used to clock the graphics engine - on NV04+ cards only
 - memory clock [MPLL]: used to clock memory and, before NV04, the graphics
   engine - not present on IGPs
 - video clock 1 [VPLL]: used to drive first/only video output
 - video clock 2 [VPLL2]: used to drive second video output - only on NV11+
   cards
[XXX: DLL on NV03]
[XXX: NV01???]

These clocks are set in PDAC [NV01] or PRAMDAC [NV03 and up] areas - see
pramdac.txt for more information.

NV40 generation cards have the following clocks:

 - host clock: clocks the host interface parts, like PFIFO
[XXX: figure out where that one comes from]
 - core clock [NVPLL]: clocks most of the card's logic
 - unknown clock 4008
[XXX: is that just the shader clock?]
 - video clocks [VPLL1,VPLL2]: used to drive the video outputs
 - memory clocks [MPLL1-MPLL4]: used to clock the VRAM, there's one of them
   for each memory partition connected to the card
 - unknown clock 4050 - not present on all cards
[XXX: figure it out]
 - unknown clock 4058 - not present on all cards
[XXX: figure it out]

The clocks other than VPLLs are set through the new PCLOCK area
[see nv40-pclock.txt], VPLLs are set through PRAMDAC like before.

NV50:NVA3 cards have the following clocks:

 - crystal clock: input from a quartz crystal, user as the base for other
   clocks
 - PCIE reference clock [HREF]: input from the PCIE bus, used as the base
   for other clocks
 - root clocks [RPLL1, RPLL2]: used as the base for other clocks
 - host clock [HCLK]: clocks the host interface parts, like PFIFO
 - timer clock [TCLK]: clocks the PTIMER circuitry, only present on NV84+
 - NVIO clock [IOCLK]: used for communication with the NVIO chip, NV50 and
   NVA0 only
[XXX: figure out this, the ZPLL, and the DOM6]
 - memory clock [MCLK]: used to clock the VRAM, not present on IGPs
 - unknown clock 4010: present on NV50, NV92, NVA0 only
 - unknown clock 4018: present on NV50, NVA0 only
 - unknown clock 4088: present on NVA0 only
[XXX: figure these out]
 - core clock [NVCLK]: clocks most of the card's logic
 - shader clock [SCLK]: clocks the CUDA multiprocessor / shader units
 - xtensa clock [XTCLK]: clocks the xtensa cores used for video decoding,
   only present on NV84:NV98 and NVA0
 - vdec clock [VDCLK]: clocks the remaining parts of video decoding engines,
   only present on NV84+
 - video clocks [VCLK1,VCLK2]: used to drive the video outputs

The root clocks are set up in PNVIO area [see pnvio.txt], VPLLs are set up in
PDISPLAY area [see pdisplay.txt], and the other clocks are set up in PCLOCK
area [see nv50-pclock.txt].

NVA3:NVC0 cards have the following clocks:

 - root clocks [RPLL1-4]: used as base for other clocks
[XXX: how many are there exactly?]
 - host clock: clocks the host interface parts, like PFIFO
[XXX: figure out where that one comes from]
 - core clock [NVPLL, clock #0/#16]: clocks most of the card's logic
 - shader clock [SPLL, clock #1/#17]: clocks the CUDA multiprocessor / shader units
 - memory clock [MPLL, clock #2/#18]: used to clock the VRAM, not present on IGPs
 - video clock 1 [VPLL1, clock #8/#24]: used to drive the video outputs
 - video clock 2 [VPLL2, clock #9/#25]: used to drive the video outputs
 - timer clock [TCLK, clock #28]: clocks the PTIMER circuitry
 - unknown clock #29
 - unknown clock #30
 - unknown clock #32
 - vdec clock [clock #33]: used to clock the fuc video decoding engines
 - unknown clock #36
 - daemon clock [clock #37]: used to clock PDAEMON
 - unknown clock #39

The root clocks are set up in PNVIO area [see pnvio.txt], VPLLs are set up in
PDISPLAY area [see pdisplay.txt], and the other clocks are set up in PCLOCK
area [see nva3-pclock.txt].

NVC0+ cards have the following clocks:

 - root clocks [RPLL1-4]: used as base for other clocks
[XXX: how many are there exactly?]
 - host clock: clocks the host interface parts, like PFIFO
[XXX: figure out where that one comes from]
 - GPC clock [GPCPLL, clock #0]: used to clock the GPCs
 - ROP clock [ROPPLL, clock #1]: used to clock the ROPs - not present on NVC1, XBAR clock used instead
 - XBAR clock [XBARPLL, clock #2]: used to clock the crossbar between GPCs and ROPs, as well as ROPs on NVC1
 - core clock [NVPLL, clock #7]: clocks the core card logic
 - VM clock [clock #8]: clocks the TLBs and page table lookup circuitry [XXX: guess]
 - HUB clock [clock #9]: clocks the common part of PGRAPH, and the PCOPY engines
 - timer clock [TCLK, clock #11]: clocks the PTIMER circuitry
 - daemon clock [clock #12]: used to clock PDAEMON
 - vdec clock [clock #14]: used to clock the fuc video decoding engines
 - memory clock [MPLL, clock M]: used to clock the VRAM, one per memory partition
[XXX: uses two PLLs, actually]

The root clocks are set up in PNVIO area [see pnvio.txt], VPLLs are set up in
PDISPLAY area [see pdisplay.txt], the MPLLs are set up in PMCLOCK area, and
the other clocks are set up in PCLOCK area [see nvc0-pclock.txt].
