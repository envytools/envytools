= Building, installing =

Dependencies: cmake, libxml2, flex, bison, pkg-config
Optional dependencies needed by nva: libpciaccess
Optional dependencies needed by vdpow: vdpau, libx11

If your distribution has -dev or -devel packages, you'll also need ones
corresponding to the dependencies above.

To build, use

 $ cmake .
 $ make

To install [which is optional], use

 $ make install

If you want to install to a non-default directory, you'll also need to pass
it as an option to cmake before building, eg.:

 $ cmake -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/usr/local .
